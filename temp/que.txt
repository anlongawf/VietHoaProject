10.1 Under what circumstances do page faults occur? Describe the actions
taken by the operating system when a page fault occurs.

n distinct page numbers occur in it. Answer these questions for any
page-replacement algorithms:
a. What is a lower bound on the number of page faults?
b. What is an upper bound on the number of page faults?
